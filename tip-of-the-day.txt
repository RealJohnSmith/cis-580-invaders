Q-Bond is a process to join or glue technical textiles together. One common usage is the joining of sail cloths or sail panels with the Q-Bond Method. Q-Bonded sails are used on boats in large sail racing championships like the Volvo Ocean Race, Americas Cup, and Louis Vuitton Cup. Some top sailmakers believe the Q-Bond method to be one of the strongest joints in the sailmaking world.
