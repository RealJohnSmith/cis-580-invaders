The Commission of Government was a non-elected body that governed the dominion of Newfoundland from 1934 to 1949. Established following the collapse of Newfoundland's economy during the Great Depression, it was dissolved when the former dominion became the tenth province of Canada. It was composed of civil servants who were directly subordinate to the British Government in London.
